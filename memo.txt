Course Description
NumPy is an essential Python library. TensorFlow and scikit-learn use NumPy arrays as inputs, and pandas and Matplotlib are built on top of NumPy. In this Introduction to NumPy course, you'll become a master wrangler of NumPy's core object: arrays! Using data from New York City's tree census, you'll create, sort, filter, and update arrays. You'll discover why NumPy is so efficient and use broadcasting and vectorization to make your NumPy code even faster. By the end of the course, you'll be using 3D arrays to alter a Claude Monet painting, and you'll understand why such array alterations are essential tools for machine learning.
